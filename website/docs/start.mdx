Without any props, DayPicker renders a simple calendar. Start adding [some props](./props) to make the calendar interactive.

For example:

- enable the navigation between months;
- respond to day events by selecting or deselecting days;
- choose which days should be disabled.

## Enable Navigation Between Months

To allow the user navigate between months:

1. keep the current visible month in the parent component’s state;
2. use the [`month`](./props#month) prop to display the current month in the calendar;
3. update the month using [`onMonthChange`](./props#onmonthchange).

When adding the `onMonthChange` prop, a Navigation Bar will appear next to the caption.

```jsx preview
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { DayPicker } from 'react-day-picker';

function App() {
  const initialMonth = new Date(2019, 8);
  const [month, setMonth] = useState(initialMonth);

  return <DayPicker month={month} onMonthChange={month => setMonth(month)} />;
}
```

## Selecting a Day from the Calendar

To allow users to select a day from the calendar:

1. listen to the [`onDayClick`](./props#ondayclick) event to get the clicked day;
2. save the clicked day in your component's state;
3. highlight the selected day using the [`selected`](./props#selected) prop.

```jsx preview
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { DayPicker } from 'react-day-picker';

function App() {
  const [selectedDay, setSelectedDay] = useState();
  const [month, setMonth] = useState();

  return (
    <div>
      <DayPicker
        month={month}
        selected={selectedDay}
        onDayClick={day => setSelectedDay(day)}
        onMonthChange={month => setMonth(month)}
      />
      <h4>{selectedDay ? selectedDay.toLocaleDateString() : 'Pick a day'}</h4>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Selecting or Unselecting Multiple Days

There are [many options to match days](./matching-days) via the `selected` prop. By playing with `onDayClick` and the component’s state, it is possible to extend the DayPicker behaviour in multiple ways.

For example, to select multiple days:

1. initialize the state with an empty array;
2. add the day to the array when a day is clicked;
3. check if the day is already selected to unselect it.

```jsx preview
import { DayPicker } from 'react-day-picker';
import { isSameDay } from 'date-fns';

function App() {
  const [selectedDays, setSelectedDays] = useState([]);
  const [month, setMonth] = useState();

  const handleDayClick = day => {
    setSelectedDays(currentDays => {
      const selectedIndex = currentDays.findIndex(d => isSameDay(d, day));
      if (selectedIndex > -1) {
        const newDays = [...currentDays];
        newDays.splice(selectedIndex, 1);
        return newDays;
      }
      return [...currentDays, day];
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <DayPicker
        month={month}
        selected={selectedDays}
        onDayClick={handleDayClick}
        onMonthChange={month => setMonth(month)}
      />
      <h4>
        {selectedDays.length > 0
          ? `You picked ${selectedDays.length} day(s)`
          : 'Select some days'}
      </h4>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Disabling or Hiding Days

Similarly to `selected`, the `hidden` and `disabled` props can be used to hide or disable the day cell. These props too support [few useful types](./matching-days).

For example, the following DayPicker shows a calendar where Tuesdays are disabled and few days are hidden.

```jsx preview
import { DayPicker } from 'react-day-picker';

function App() {
  const [selectedDay, setSelectedDay] = useState([]);
  const isTuesday = day => day.getDay() === 2;
  const hiddenDays = [
    new Date(2019, 8, 26),
    new Date(2019, 8, 27),
    new Date(2019, 8, 28),
  ];
  return (
    <DayPicker
      month={new Date(2019, 8)}
      selected={selectedDay}
      hidden={hiddenDays}
      disabled={isTuesday}
      onDayClick={day => setSelectedDay(day)}
    />
  );
}
```
