### Installing and importing DayPicker

1. Add `react-day-picker` and [`date-fns`](https://date-fns.org/) to the project's dependencies:

  ```bash
  # if using yarn:
  yarn add date-fns react-day-picker

  # if using npm:
  npm install date-fns react-day-picker
  ```

2. import `DayPicker`. Without any prop, `DayPicker` renders the current month.

  ```jsx preview
  import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker";

  function App() {
    return <DayPicker />;
  }
  ```
